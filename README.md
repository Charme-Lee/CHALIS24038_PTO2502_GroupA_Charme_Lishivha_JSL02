# JSL02 Project Brief: Task Input and Status Validation System

## üìã Overview

This project presents a visually precise Kanban board designed to closely reflect the original Figma design specifications. The user interface features clearly defined task columns, a static sidebar for streamlined navigation, and a cohesive visual theme that ensures a polished and professional experience across both desktop and mobile platforms.

The application is a responsive, browser-based task manager that enables users to visually organize and monitor tasks through three workflow stages: TODO, DOING, and DONE. With its clean layout and interactive prompt-based task input, it provides an intuitive and accessible entry point to effective task management.

## Expected Outcome

A functional task entry system that ensures accurate data collection, validation, and structured storage while maintaining clean and well-documented code for easy future modifications.

**Prompt Input Example**

- The program must prompt users for task 1 title, descrition and status inputs, it must do the same for task 2 information

**Invalid status**

- If the user enters a status other than `todo`, `doing` or `done`, the program must alert the user of this and return to prompting them to enter a status.
